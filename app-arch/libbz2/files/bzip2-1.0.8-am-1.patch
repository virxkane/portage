+
+0.9.0
+~~~~~
+First version.
+
+
+0.9.0a
+~~~~~~
+Removed 'ranlib' from Makefile, since most modern Unix-es 
+don't need it, or even know about it.
+
+
+0.9.0b
+~~~~~~
+Fixed a problem with error reporting in bzip2.c.  This does not effect
+the library in any way.  Problem is: versions 0.9.0 and 0.9.0a (of the
+program proper) compress and decompress correctly, but give misleading
+error messages (internal panics) when an I/O error occurs, instead of
+reporting the problem correctly.  This shouldn't give any data loss
+(as far as I can see), but is confusing.
+
+Made the inline declarations disappear for non-GCC compilers.
+
+
+0.9.0c
+~~~~~~
+Fixed some problems in the library pertaining to some boundary cases.
+This makes the library behave more correctly in those situations.  The
+fixes apply only to features (calls and parameters) not used by
+bzip2.c, so the non-fixedness of them in previous versions has no
+effect on reliability of bzip2.c.
+
+In bzlib.c:
+   * made zero-length BZ_FLUSH work correctly in bzCompress().
+   * fixed bzWrite/bzRead to ignore zero-length requests.
+   * fixed bzread to correctly handle read requests after EOF.
+   * wrong parameter order in call to bzDecompressInit in
+     bzBuffToBuffDecompress.  Fixed.
+
+In compress.c:
+   * changed setting of nGroups in sendMTFValues() so as to 
+     do a bit better on small files.  This _does_ effect
+     bzip2.c.
+
+
+0.9.5a
+~~~~~~
+Major change: add a fallback sorting algorithm (blocksort.c)
+to give reasonable behaviour even for very repetitive inputs.
+Nuked --repetitive-best and --repetitive-fast since they are
+no longer useful.
+
+Minor changes: mostly a whole bunch of small changes/
+bugfixes in the driver (bzip2.c).  Changes pertaining to the
+user interface are:
+
+   allow decompression of symlink'd files to stdout
+   decompress/test files even without .bz2 extension
+   give more accurate error messages for I/O errors
+   when compressing/decompressing to stdout, don't catch control-C
+   read flags from BZIP2 and BZIP environment variables
+   decline to break hard links to a file unless forced with -f
+   allow -c flag even with no filenames
+   preserve file ownerships as far as possible
+   make -s -1 give the expected block size (100k)
+   add a flag -q --quiet to suppress nonessential warnings
+   stop decoding flags after --, so files beginning in - can be handled
+   resolved inconsistent naming: bzcat or bz2cat ?
+   bzip2 --help now returns 0
+
+Programming-level changes are:
+
+   fixed syntax error in GET_LL4 for Borland C++ 5.02
+   let bzBuffToBuffDecompress return BZ_DATA_ERROR{_MAGIC}
+   fix overshoot of mode-string end in bzopen_or_bzdopen
+   wrapped bzlib.h in #ifdef __cplusplus ... extern "C" { ... }
+   close file handles under all error conditions
+   added minor mods so it compiles with DJGPP out of the box
+   fixed Makefile so it doesn't give problems with BSD make
+   fix uninitialised memory reads in dlltest.c
+
+0.9.5b
+~~~~~~
+Open stdin/stdout in binary mode for DJGPP.
+
+0.9.5c
+~~~~~~
+Changed BZ_N_OVERSHOOT to be ... + 2 instead of ... + 1.  The + 1
+version could cause the sorted order to be wrong in some extremely
+obscure cases.  Also changed setting of quadrant in blocksort.c.
+
+0.9.5d
+~~~~~~
+The only functional change is to make bzlibVersion() in the library
+return the correct string.  This has no effect whatsoever on the
+functioning of the bzip2 program or library.  Added a couple of casts
+so the library compiles without warnings at level 3 in MS Visual
+Studio 6.0.  Included a Y2K statement in the file Y2K_INFO.  All other
+changes are minor documentation changes.
+
+1.0
+~~~
+Several minor bugfixes and enhancements:
+
+* Large file support.  The library uses 64-bit counters to
+  count the volume of data passing through it.  bzip2.c 
+  is now compiled with -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 to get large
+  file support from the C library.  -v correctly prints out
+  file sizes greater than 4 gigabytes.  All these changes have
+  been made without assuming a 64-bit platform or a C compiler
+  which supports 64-bit ints, so, except for the C library
+  aspect, they are fully portable.
+
+* Decompression robustness.  The library/program should be
+  robust to any corruption of compressed data, detecting and
+  handling _all_ corruption, instead of merely relying on
+  the CRCs.  What this means is that the program should 
+  never crash, given corrupted data, and the library should
+  always return BZ_DATA_ERROR.
+
+* Fixed an obscure race-condition bug only ever observed on
+  Solaris, in which, if you were very unlucky and issued
+  control-C at exactly the wrong time, both input and output
+  files would be deleted.
+
+* Don't run out of file handles on test/decompression when
+  large numbers of files have invalid magic numbers.
+
+* Avoid library namespace pollution.  Prefix all exported 
+  symbols with BZ2_.
+
+* Minor sorting enhancements from my DCC2000 paper.
+
+* Advance the version number to 1.0, so as to counteract the
+  (false-in-this-case) impression some people have that programs 
+  with version numbers less than 1.0 are in some way, experimental,
+  pre-release versions.
+
+* Create an initial Makefile-libbz2_so to build a shared library.
+  Yes, I know I should really use libtool et al ...
+
+* Make the program exit with 2 instead of 0 when decompression
+  fails due to a bad magic number (ie, an invalid bzip2 header).
+  Also exit with 1 (as the manual claims :-) whenever a diagnostic
+  message would have been printed AND the corresponding operation 
+  is aborted, for example
+     bzip2: Output file xx already exists.
+  When a diagnostic message is printed but the operation is not 
+  aborted, for example
+     bzip2: Can't guess original name for wurble -- using wurble.out
+  then the exit value 0 is returned, unless some other problem is
+  also detected.
+
+  I think it corresponds more closely to what the manual claims now.
+
+
+1.0.1
+~~~~~
+* Modified dlltest.c so it uses the new BZ2_ naming scheme.
+* Modified makefile-msc to fix minor build probs on Win2k.
+* Updated README.COMPILATION.PROBLEMS.
+
+There are no functionality changes or bug fixes relative to version
+1.0.0.  This is just a documentation update + a fix for minor Win32
+build problems.  For almost everyone, upgrading from 1.0.0 to 1.0.1 is
+utterly pointless.  Don't bother.
+
+
+1.0.2
+~~~~~
+A bug fix release, addressing various minor issues which have appeared
+in the 18 or so months since 1.0.1 was released.  Most of the fixes
+are to do with file-handling or documentation bugs.  To the best of my
+knowledge, there have been no data-loss-causing bugs reported in the
+compression/decompression engine of 1.0.0 or 1.0.1.
+
+Note that this release does not improve the rather crude build system
+for Unix platforms.  The general plan here is to autoconfiscate/
+libtoolise 1.0.2 soon after release, and release the result as 1.1.0
+or perhaps 1.2.0.  That, however, is still just a plan at this point.
+
+Here are the changes in 1.0.2.  Bug-reporters and/or patch-senders in
+parentheses.
+
+* Fix an infinite segfault loop in 1.0.1 when a directory is
+  encountered in -f (force) mode.
+     (Trond Eivind Glomsrod, Nicholas Nethercote, Volker Schmidt)
+
+* Avoid double fclose() of output file on certain I/O error paths.
+     (Solar Designer)
+
+* Don't fail with internal error 1007 when fed a long stream (> 48MB)
+  of byte 251.  Also print useful message suggesting that 1007s may be
+  caused by bad memory.
+     (noticed by Juan Pedro Vallejo, fixed by me)
+
+* Fix uninitialised variable silly bug in demo prog dlltest.c.
+     (Jorj Bauer)
+
+* Remove 512-MB limitation on recovered file size for bzip2recover
+  on selected platforms which support 64-bit ints.  At the moment
+  all GCC supported platforms, and Win32.
+     (me, Alson van der Meulen)
+
+* Hard-code header byte values, to give correct operation on platforms
+  using EBCDIC as their native character set (IBM's OS/390).
+     (Leland Lucius)
+
+* Copy file access times correctly.
+     (Marty Leisner)
+
+* Add distclean and check targets to Makefile.
+     (Michael Carmack)
+
+* Parameterise use of ar and ranlib in Makefile.  Also add $(LDFLAGS).
+     (Rich Ireland, Bo Thorsen)
+
+* Pass -p (create parent dirs as needed) to mkdir during make install.
+     (Jeremy Fusco)
+
+* Dereference symlinks when copying file permissions in -f mode.
+     (Volker Schmidt)
+
+* Majorly simplify implementation of uInt64_qrm10.
+     (Bo Lindbergh)
+
+* Check the input file still exists before deleting the output one,
+  when aborting in cleanUpAndFail().
+     (Joerg Prante, Robert Linden, Matthias Krings)
+
+Also a bunch of patches courtesy of Philippe Troin, the Debian maintainer
+of bzip2:
+
+* Wrapper scripts (with manpages): bzdiff, bzgrep, bzmore.
+
+* Spelling changes and minor enhancements in bzip2.1.
+
+* Avoid race condition between creating the output file and setting its
+  interim permissions safely, by using fopen_output_safely().
+  No changes to bzip2recover since there is no issue with file
+  permissions there.
+
+* do not print senseless report with -v when compressing an empty
+  file.
+
+* bzcat -f works on non-bzip2 files.
+
+* do not try to escape shell meta-characters on unix (the shell takes
+  care of these).
+
+* added --fast and --best aliases for -1 -9 for gzip compatibility.
+
+
+1.0.3 (15 Feb 05)
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+Fixes some minor bugs since the last version, 1.0.2.
+
+* Further robustification against corrupted compressed data.
+  There are currently no known bitstreams which can cause the
+  decompressor to crash, loop or access memory which does not
+  belong to it.  If you are using bzip2 or the library to 
+  decompress bitstreams from untrusted sources, an upgrade
+  to 1.0.3 is recommended.  This fixes CAN-2005-1260.
+
+* The documentation has been converted to XML, from which html
+  and pdf can be derived.
+
+* Various minor bugs in the documentation have been fixed.
+
+* Fixes for various compilation warnings with newer versions of
+  gcc, and on 64-bit platforms.
+
+* The BZ_NO_STDIO cpp symbol was not properly observed in 1.0.2.
+  This has been fixed.
+
+
+1.0.4 (20 Dec 06)
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+Fixes some minor bugs since the last version, 1.0.3.
+
+* Fix file permissions race problem (CAN-2005-0953).
+
+* Avoid possible segfault in BZ2_bzclose.  From Coverity's NetBSD
+  scan.
+
+* 'const'/prototype cleanups in the C code.
+
+* Change default install location to /usr/local, and handle multiple
+  'make install's without error.
+
+* Sanitise file names more carefully in bzgrep.  Fixes CAN-2005-0758
+  to the extent that applies to bzgrep.
+
+* Use 'mktemp' rather than 'tempfile' in bzdiff.
+
+* Tighten up a couple of assertions in blocksort.c following automated
+  analysis.
+
+* Fix minor doc/comment bugs.
+
+
+1.0.5 (10 Dec 07)
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+Security fix only.  Fixes CERT-FI 20469 as it applies to bzip2.
+
+
+1.0.6 (6 Sept 10)
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+* Security fix for CVE-2010-0405.  This was reported by Mikolaj
+  Izdebski.
+
+* Make the documentation build on Ubuntu 10.04
+
+1.0.7 (27 Jun 19)
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+* Fix undefined behavior in the macros SET_BH, CLEAR_BH, & ISSET_BH
+
+* bzip2: Fix return value when combining --test,-t and -q.
+
+* bzip2recover: Fix buffer overflow for large argv[0]
+
+* bzip2recover: Fix use after free issue with outFile (CVE-2016-3189)
+
+* Make sure nSelectors is not out of range (CVE-2019-12900)
+
+1.0.8 (13 Jul 19)
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+* Accept as many selectors as the file format allows.
+  This relaxes the fix for CVE-2019-12900 from 1.0.7
+  so that bzip2 allows decompression of bz2 files that
+  use (too) many selectors again.
+
+* Fix handling of large (> 4GB) files on Windows.
+
+* Cleanup of bzdiff and bzgrep scripts so they don't use
+  any bash extensions and handle multiple archives correctly.
+
+* There is now a bz2-files testsuite at
+  https://sourceware.org/git/bzip2-tests.git

+Installation Instructions
+*************************
+
+Copyright (C) 1994, 1995, 1996, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2004, 2005,
+2006 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
+
+This file is free documentation; the Free Software Foundation gives
+unlimited permission to copy, distribute and modify it.
+
+Basic Installation
+==================
+
+Briefly, the shell commands `./configure; make; make install' should
+configure, build, and install this package.  The following
+more-detailed instructions are generic; see the `README' file for
+instructions specific to this package.
+
+   The `configure' shell script attempts to guess correct values for
+various system-dependent variables used during compilation.  It uses
+those values to create a `Makefile' in each directory of the package.
+It may also create one or more `.h' files containing system-dependent
+definitions.  Finally, it creates a shell script `config.status' that
+you can run in the future to recreate the current configuration, and a
+file `config.log' containing compiler output (useful mainly for
+debugging `configure').
+
+   It can also use an optional file (typically called `config.cache'
+and enabled with `--cache-file=config.cache' or simply `-C') that saves
+the results of its tests to speed up reconfiguring.  Caching is
+disabled by default to prevent problems with accidental use of stale
+cache files.
+
+   If you need to do unusual things to compile the package, please try
+to figure out how `configure' could check whether to do them, and mail
+diffs or instructions to the address given in the `README' so they can
+be considered for the next release.  If you are using the cache, and at
+some point `config.cache' contains results you don't want to keep, you
+may remove or edit it.
+
+   The file `configure.ac' (or `configure.in') is used to create
+`configure' by a program called `autoconf'.  You need `configure.ac' if
+you want to change it or regenerate `configure' using a newer version
+of `autoconf'.
+
+The simplest way to compile this package is:
+
+  1. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and type
+     `./configure' to configure the package for your system.
+
+     Running `configure' might take a while.  While running, it prints
+     some messages telling which features it is checking for.
+
+  2. Type `make' to compile the package.
+
+  3. Optionally, type `make check' to run any self-tests that come with
+     the package.
+
+  4. Type `make install' to install the programs and any data files and
+     documentation.
+
+  5. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
+     source code directory by typing `make clean'.  To also remove the
+     files that `configure' created (so you can compile the package for
+     a different kind of computer), type `make distclean'.  There is
+     also a `make maintainer-clean' target, but that is intended mainly
+     for the package's developers.  If you use it, you may have to get
+     all sorts of other programs in order to regenerate files that came
+     with the distribution.
+
+Compilers and Options
+=====================
+
+Some systems require unusual options for compilation or linking that the
+`configure' script does not know about.  Run `./configure --help' for
+details on some of the pertinent environment variables.
+
+   You can give `configure' initial values for configuration parameters
+by setting variables in the command line or in the environment.  Here
+is an example:
+
+     ./configure CC=c99 CFLAGS=-g LIBS=-lposix
+
+   *Note Defining Variables::, for more details.
+
+Compiling For Multiple Architectures
+====================================
+
+You can compile the package for more than one kind of computer at the
+same time, by placing the object files for each architecture in their
+own directory.  To do this, you can use GNU `make'.  `cd' to the
+directory where you want the object files and executables to go and run
+the `configure' script.  `configure' automatically checks for the
+source code in the directory that `configure' is in and in `..'.
+
+   With a non-GNU `make', it is safer to compile the package for one
+architecture at a time in the source code directory.  After you have
+installed the package for one architecture, use `make distclean' before
+reconfiguring for another architecture.
+
+Installation Names
+==================
+
+By default, `make install' installs the package's commands under
+`/usr/local/bin', include files under `/usr/local/include', etc.  You
+can specify an installation prefix other than `/usr/local' by giving
+`configure' the option `--prefix=PREFIX'.
+
+   You can specify separate installation prefixes for
+architecture-specific files and architecture-independent files.  If you
+pass the option `--exec-prefix=PREFIX' to `configure', the package uses
+PREFIX as the prefix for installing programs and libraries.
+Documentation and other data files still use the regular prefix.
+
+   In addition, if you use an unusual directory layout you can give
+options like `--bindir=DIR' to specify different values for particular
+kinds of files.  Run `configure --help' for a list of the directories
+you can set and what kinds of files go in them.
+
+   If the package supports it, you can cause programs to be installed
+with an extra prefix or suffix on their names by giving `configure' the
+option `--program-prefix=PREFIX' or `--program-suffix=SUFFIX'.
+
+Optional Features
+=================
+
+Some packages pay attention to `--enable-FEATURE' options to
+`configure', where FEATURE indicates an optional part of the package.
+They may also pay attention to `--with-PACKAGE' options, where PACKAGE
+is something like `gnu-as' or `x' (for the X Window System).  The
+`README' should mention any `--enable-' and `--with-' options that the
+package recognizes.
+
+   For packages that use the X Window System, `configure' can usually
+find the X include and library files automatically, but if it doesn't,
+you can use the `configure' options `--x-includes=DIR' and
+`--x-libraries=DIR' to specify their locations.
+
+Specifying the System Type
+==========================
+
+There may be some features `configure' cannot figure out automatically,
+but needs to determine by the type of machine the package will run on.
+Usually, assuming the package is built to be run on the _same_
+architectures, `configure' can figure that out, but if it prints a
+message saying it cannot guess the machine type, give it the
+`--build=TYPE' option.  TYPE can either be a short name for the system
+type, such as `sun4', or a canonical name which has the form:
+
+     CPU-COMPANY-SYSTEM
+
+where SYSTEM can have one of these forms:
+
+     OS KERNEL-OS
+
+   See the file `config.sub' for the possible values of each field.  If
+`config.sub' isn't included in this package, then this package doesn't
+need to know the machine type.
+
+   If you are _building_ compiler tools for cross-compiling, you should
+use the option `--target=TYPE' to select the type of system they will
+produce code for.
+
+   If you want to _use_ a cross compiler, that generates code for a
+platform different from the build platform, you should specify the
+"host" platform (i.e., that on which the generated programs will
+eventually be run) with `--host=TYPE'.
+
+Sharing Defaults
+================
+
+If you want to set default values for `configure' scripts to share, you
+can create a site shell script called `config.site' that gives default
+values for variables like `CC', `cache_file', and `prefix'.
+`configure' looks for `PREFIX/share/config.site' if it exists, then
+`PREFIX/etc/config.site' if it exists.  Or, you can set the
+`CONFIG_SITE' environment variable to the location of the site script.
+A warning: not all `configure' scripts look for a site script.
+
+Defining Variables
+==================
+
+Variables not defined in a site shell script can be set in the
+environment passed to `configure'.  However, some packages may run
+configure again during the build, and the customized values of these
+variables may be lost.  In order to avoid this problem, you should set
+them in the `configure' command line, using `VAR=value'.  For example:
+
+     ./configure CC=/usr/local2/bin/gcc
+
+causes the specified `gcc' to be used as the C compiler (unless it is
+overridden in the site shell script).
+
+Unfortunately, this technique does not work for `CONFIG_SHELL' due to
+an Autoconf bug.  Until the bug is fixed you can use this workaround:
+
+     CONFIG_SHELL=/bin/bash /bin/bash ./configure CONFIG_SHELL=/bin/bash
+
+`configure' Invocation
+======================
+
+`configure' recognizes the following options to control how it operates.
+
+`--help'
+`-h'
+     Print a summary of the options to `configure', and exit.
+
+`--version'
+`-V'
+     Print the version of Autoconf used to generate the `configure'
+     script, and exit.
+
+`--cache-file=FILE'
+     Enable the cache: use and save the results of the tests in FILE,
+     traditionally `config.cache'.  FILE defaults to `/dev/null' to
+     disable caching.
+
+`--config-cache'
+`-C'
+     Alias for `--cache-file=config.cache'.
+
+`--quiet'
+`--silent'
+`-q'
+     Do not print messages saying which checks are being made.  To
+     suppress all normal output, redirect it to `/dev/null' (any error
+     messages will still be shown).
+
+`--srcdir=DIR'
+     Look for the package's source code in directory DIR.  Usually
+     `configure' can determine that directory automatically.
+
+`configure' also accepts some other, not widely useful, options.  Run
+`configure --help' for more details.
